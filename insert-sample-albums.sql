-- Day 1 (Jan 1): Unknown Pleasures
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(1, 'Unknown Pleasures', 'Joy Division', 'A stark black cover dominated by a small mysterious data display printed in white. The image shows a series of jagged white lines—actually radio pulses from a distant pulsar—undulating across the black backdrop. No text or title appears on the front, giving it a haunting, minimalist power that invites the listener into the void.');

-- Day 30 (Jan 30): Abbey Road
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(30, 'Abbey Road', 'The Beatles', 'Perhaps the most famous crosswalk on Earth. The cover photo captures the four Beatles striding across a zebra crossing outside EMI Studios in London. John leads, followed by Ringo, Paul (barefoot and out of step) and George, all walking from left to right on the sunlit street. The white-painted stripes of the crosswalk and the tree-lined road set a simple stage for this iconic scene, forever freezing The Beatles'' casual commute into legend.');

-- Day 60 (Mar 1): Dark Side of the Moon
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(60, 'The Dark Side of the Moon', 'Pink Floyd', 'A clean black background with a prism dispersing a thin beam of white light into a vibrant rainbow. The white light enters from the left, hits the triangular glass prism at center, and fans out into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet against the darkness. This simple geometric design, with its sharp lines and spectral colors, conveys both scientific precision and psychedelic wonder in one glance.');

-- Day 90 (Mar 31): Nevermind
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(90, 'Nevermind', 'Nirvana', 'Beneath the rippling blue of a swimming pool, a naked baby floats underwater, arms and eyes wide open. In front of him dangles a U.S. dollar bill hooked on a fishing line, just out of reach. The infant (with wisps of light brown hair) appears calm yet determined, instinctively "chasing" the money. The scene is innocent and unsettling at once – a playful image turned sharp social commentary, all bathed in the clear aquatic blue of the pool.');

-- Day 120 (Apr 30): Sgt. Pepper
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(120, 'Sgt. Pepper''s Lonely Hearts Club Band', 'The Beatles', 'A kaleidoscope of famous faces and vibrant colors assembled as if for a public ceremony. The Fab Four stand at center in neon satin military band uniforms (pink, red, yellow, and blue), surrounded by cardboard cut-outs of dozens of historical figures and celebrities. In front of them, a flowerbed spells out "The Beatles" in bright red blooms. Wax figures of their younger selves and a host of cultural icons (from Marilyn Monroe to Albert Einstein) fill the crowded scene. Every inch of the cover bursts with detail – a pop art collage celebrating an era and its influencers.');

-- Day 150 (May 30): London Calling
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(150, 'London Calling', 'The Clash', 'In a grainy black-and-white action shot with a pink-green title overlay, bassist Paul Simonon is captured mid-smash – seconds before destroying his Fender bass guitar on stage. He stands wide-legged, about to bring the bass down like an axe, with motion blur conveying the raw energy. The top and left spell out "LONDON" in bold pink and "CALLING" in green, mirroring Elvis Presley''s debut album typography. The photo''s intensity – a moment of punk defiance frozen in time – and the homage lettering together signal an album that honors rock''s roots while shattering convention.');

-- Day 180 (Jun 29): Born in the U.S.A.
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(180, 'Born in the U.S.A.', 'Bruce Springsteen', 'An iconic slice of Americana: the lower half of Bruce Springsteen''s backside against a giant painted American flag. Bruce stands in well-worn blue jeans, a red baseball cap stuffed in his right rear pocket. He''s also wearing a simple white T-shirt, and the curves of a guitar neck peek from the frame. The bright red and white stripes of the flag backdrop contrast with the denim blue. It''s a bold, blue-collar image – Springsteen''s working-class stance framed by the Stars and Stripes – perfectly encapsulating the album''s themes without even showing his face.');

-- Day 210 (Jul 29): Thriller
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(210, 'Thriller', 'Michael Jackson', 'A glamorous yet approachable portrait of the young King of Pop. Michael reclines against a dark background, dressed in a sleek white suit jacket over a simple black shirt. A tiger cub (on some posters and inner sleeve, though not on all album covers) crawls on his leg on the inside gatefold, but the main front cover just features Michael gazing softly at the camera with a relaxed confidence. A curl of hair falls on his forehead. The album title "Thriller" is penned in a casual pink script off to one side. The overall impression is cool, smooth, and a touch magical – an image of pop royalty at ease.');

-- Day 240 (Aug 28): Purple Rain
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(240, 'Purple Rain', 'Prince and The Revolution', 'A romantic nighttime scene drenched in purple haze. Front and center, Prince sits astride a gleaming purple motorcycle, wearing a sumptuous purple trench coat and ruffled white shirt. He stares coolly at the viewer from under a cascade of dark curls. Behind him, a doorway spills fog and purple neon light, while purple flowers (irises) adorn the foreground. In the background, his love interest (Apollonia) is faintly visible retreating through a doorway. The whole image is saturated in violet and lavender tones, mixing danger and sensuality – rock heroism on a violet midnight street.');

-- Day 270 (Sep 27): Led Zeppelin IV
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(270, 'Led Zeppelin IV (Untitled)', 'Led Zeppelin', 'A curious fusion of rustic and urban imagery. At the center, an old man with weathered face is seen from behind, stooped under a bundle of dry branches tied to his back. This figure is actually a framed painting mounted on a crumbling plaster wall. The wall with peeling wallpaper fills the cover''s right side, while the left side shows the painting of the old man and his sticks. The juxtaposition is jarring – pastoral toil versus decaying modernity. The band name and title are absent entirely. Mysterious and symbolic, the cover feels like discovering an artifact in an abandoned house, inviting endless interpretation.');

-- Day 300 (Oct 27): Sticky Fingers
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(300, 'Sticky Fingers', 'The Rolling Stones', 'A close-up of a man''s denim-clad crotch front and center. The tight blue jeans, slightly faded, are viewed from mid-thigh to waist. The zipper is real (on original vinyl pressings) – a working metal zipper embedded on the sleeve that could be pulled down to reveal the underwear on an inner layer. On the flat printed version, the zipper is half-way down, showing a hint of white cotton beneath. The texture of the denim, the glint of metal, and the bold positioning is cheeky and provocative. In the top corner, simple text declares "The Rolling Stones". Designed by Andy Warhol, the cover makes a literally bold statement, fusing rock ''n'' roll sexuality with pop-art flair.');

-- Day 330 (Nov 26): Ramones
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(330, 'Ramones', 'Ramones', 'The definitive punk group portrait: all four Ramones stand against a gritty brick wall, exuding bored attitude. They''re dressed essentially identically – tattered blue jeans, leather motorcycle jackets, and sneakers – and slouch together in a line. Joey Ramone, tall and leaning, anchors the center. Johnny, Dee Dee, and Tommy flank him, all staring blankly or with slight snarls at the camera. Their names aren''t needed; the black stenciled "RAMONES" logo (added above in some versions) and their uniform look say it all. The entire image is black-and-white, grainy and raw, capturing the street-tough, no-nonsense essence of punk''s first family.');

-- Day 348 (Dec 13 - TODAY!): The Velvet Underground & Nico
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(348, 'The Velvet Underground & Nico', 'The Velvet Underground & Nico', 'A simple pale tan background bearing a bright yellow banana print designed by Andy Warhol. The banana has a few black spots and a signature in cursive that reads "Andy Warhol" below it. Early copies invited the owner to "Peel slowly and see" – indeed the banana was a sticker that could be peeled away to reveal a suggestively pink banana flesh underneath. Provocative yet minimalist, the image became an emblem of 1960s art-rock cool.');

-- Day 365 (Dec 31): Electric Ladyland
INSERT INTO daily_albums (day_of_year, title, artist, description) VALUES
(365, 'Electric Ladyland', 'The Jimi Hendrix Experience', 'A bold and controversial assembly of nineteen nude women against a black background. These women – of various body types – are seated or standing closely together, completely unclothed, gazing toward the camera. Their skin tones and hair colors vary, giving a mottled effect of flesh and shadow in the dim studio light. Some wear necklaces or hold their arms in ways that partially obscure their bodies, but breasts and hips are clearly visible. Their expressions range from defiant to indifferent. The lighting casts a warm, reddish hue on their skin. This cover, daring for 1968, was intended to shock and celebrate natural beauty. It''s a chaotic yet oddly static tableau – a human collage reflecting the wild freedom and earthiness of Hendrix''s music.');
